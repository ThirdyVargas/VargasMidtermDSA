# React JS

### What is React JS

React JS is an open-source **JavaScript library**, crafted with precision by Facebook, that aims to simplify the intricate process of building interactive user interfaces. 

Imagine a user interface built with React as a collection of components, each responsible for outputting a small, reusable piece of HTML code.
